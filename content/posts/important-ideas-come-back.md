From Basecamp's Shape Up book:

> It’s easy to overvalue ideas. The truth is, ideas are cheap. They come up all the time and accumulate into big piles.
> 
> Really important ideas will come back to you. When's the last time you forgot a really great, inspiring idea? And if it's not that interesting—maybe a bug that customers are running into from time to time—it'll come back to your attention when a customer complains again or a new customer hits it. If you hear it once and never again, maybe it wasn’t really a problem.

Long overdue, but I finished reading Shape Up. This quote stood out as I've experienced its effect first-hand.

I used to keep lists for everything little thing that popped up on my mind. Both things that I _had_ to do and things that I _wanted_ to do. These lists slowly become mountains of work with a paralyzing gaze, having the opposite effect of motivating me.

At some point I decided to delete all the baggage I'd been carrying around. It felt exhilarating!

Now I only add things to a todo list that I'm not allowed to forget. Not things that I have to or want to do. Something that's on a list for more than a week is a smell; maybe it's not as important as I thought.
