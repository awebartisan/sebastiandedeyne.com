  <p>As the year comes to an end I'm trying to do less. I'm taking a break from coding sideprojects and speaking. On the other hand, I'm trying to write more (which I'm succeeding at).</p>
  <h2>Writing</h2>
  <p>I'm trying to do weekly blog posts and monthly newsletters. I'm started my [first blog series about vanilla JavaScript](/javascript-framework-diet).</p>
  <h2>Spatie</h2>
  <p>At work I'm building <a href="https://mailcoach.app/">Mailcoach</a>, a self-hosted email campaign solution. We're building the interface without a framework, which is reinvigorating my love for a simple architecture.</p>
  <p>Besides Mailcoach, I'm working on a few Inertia/React/TypeScript based client projects.</p>
