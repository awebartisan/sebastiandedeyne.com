title: "Doing less, Full Stack Europe, lots of blogging and new packages"

Hi!

The past few months (years for some) I've been working in the following areas:

- Backend development
- Frontend development
- UI design
- UX design
- Writing
- Speaking

However, since branching out I've felt a decline in the quality in some of my work. I've also been taking on too many things at the same time, so it's time to cut down. I want to (re)focus on some specific areas in the coming months:

- Frontend development
- UX design
- Writing

I don't just want to be good at these areas, I want to become an expert.

That said, here's what I've been up to the past few weeks.

## Full Stack Europe

It's [Full Stack Europe] week! I'll be attending the conference, and I'm giving two lightning talks:

- Writing open source software, and staying sane while at it
- Four prioritization systems in four minutes

I'm working on a written version of the talks too, which I will release shortly after the conference.

## Lots of blogging

I wrote a few blog posts this month. Topics include Inertia, Livewire, React & dark mode, so there's probably something in there for everyone.

- [Inertia.js and Livewire: a high level comparison]
- [Handling routes in a Laravel and Inertia app]
- [This site now supports dark mode]
- [Writing a custom React hook: Google Places autocomplete]

## Laravel Mix Preload & Laravel Export

Last month I said I'd be working on two Spatie packages, [laravel-mix-preload] & [laravel-export].

I tagged v1 of Laravel Mix Preload, read my [announcement post] for the full story.

I also completely rewrote Laravel Export, but haven't been able to get push out a v1 yet. It's still missing tests and a few minor features. Hopefully I can get that over with this month so I can scratch it off my todo list.

## On the horizon

A few things I'm planning to work on the coming weeks;

Next week I'm going to spend some time to create a few solid React examples for the Inertia docs. I hope that will inspire more people to give it a try!

As I mentioned above, I want to get Laravel Export v1 out of the door. I also want to do some more blogging about tech-related-but-non-tech topics, like remote work and workflow related things.

Besides that, I'm going to try to keep things calm with the holiday season around the corner. Time to sit back, play some Hearthstone, work on some DIY projects,â€¦ Time for a break.

Until the next issue,

Seb
